I have the game flow working all the way up to hit and stay (while playing a hand).

I have not tested more than one hand.

Hit was not adding cards, but should be now.

I have added checking to see if a player is busted, and then moving on, but have not tested it at all.

The deck seems to always be dealing the same cards :(  Maybe you have to seed the random number generator???

I have stubbed the dealer hand, but done nothing with it.
