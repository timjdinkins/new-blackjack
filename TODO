Start back in on the Player.

I left off with refactoring the casino to track tables as lists, instead of more complex data types.

I refactored the table object to treat players as a simple list as well, ignoring the "seat".

The Game was tweaked a little to deal with this as well.

Next up is "make sure the game actually works, though we may need a functional player to do that" and then make sure the player works and can work in this new system.
