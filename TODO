I have finished refactoring the game so that it will send messages to players, instead of printing to the console.  It also now deals with players as a list of tuples instead of a dictionary.

I need to now get it to compile, plus set up the user to handle the messages the game sends.

I need to then set up the user to message it's proxy with the messages it gets from the game.

I left off with refactoring the casino to track tables as lists, instead of more complex data types.

I refactored the table object to treat players as a simple list as well, ignoring the "seat".

The Game was tweaked a little to deal with this as well.

Next up is "make sure the game actually works, though we may need a functional player to do that" and then make sure the player works and can work in this new system.
